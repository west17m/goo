# OJournal 9

The last thing I needed to do was to start this project over, yet here we are. 
This time around, the stack is SQLAlchemy, pytest, fastapi, and React. 

## Dev
Here is the quickstart to download the project and start development

 ```bash
git clone git@github.com:west17m/ojournal9.git
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Now inside the virtual environment

```bashv
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
```
